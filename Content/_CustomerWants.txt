We are family friendly so we can't have super scary stuff all over the website - think 1950s frankenstein, dracula and the wolfman - but we need modern stuff too, I'm excited to see the ideas you come up with!

Our stores move around alot i.e. going to inepxensive store fronts during the Halloween season, can we have something where we can update the addresses (usually 6 locations but could be more as we grow) from year to year?  Would be great if it had some Google Maps stuff built in?

We don't have our social media team setup yet, can you please just stub in links to facebook, twitter and instagram?

We get tonnes of testimonials, and most of them are good.  Could we have something on the website where people can put in thier testimonals and then we approve or reject them on the back end?  We don't need any 1s or 2s on the site - of course we'll give those people a call and see if we can help.

I know this is a big ask, but could we have something along the lines of product management.  The Halloween business is fast moving and products change rapidly due to a demanding customer base.  Anything that can help us update our availabe products (title, description, pictures) on the site would be great!  One thing to note...it shouldn't be an online store, we aren't really set up for shipping or anything - just product management.
