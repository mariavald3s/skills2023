"This store is a lifesaver! My kid decided at the last minute that they wanted to be a specific 
character, and we couldn't find the costume anywhere else. But this store had it in stock and even helped us find some matching accessories. I'm so grateful!" - Karen W.

"I was a little nervous about going to a Halloween store during the pandemic, but this place really had their 
safety protocols in place. They limited the number of people in the store, had hand sanitizer everywhere, and everyone was wearing masks. I felt totally 
comfortable and had a great shopping experience.  I still got sick though." - Emily G.

"I love that this store has options for all ages and sizes. My daughter wanted to be a character from her favorite 
cartoon, and they had costumes in her size that were actually cute and not just a cheap-looking knockoff. I also found a great outfit for myself, 
and my husband was able to find something that fit him well too. We'll definitely be back next year!" - Maria S.
